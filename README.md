# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the code used during the studies of Natural Language Processing.

It is divided into following sub-topics.

## Vectorization and Embeddings

These are the methods that can be used to turn a text in natural human-readable language into numerical data. Some of the methods are used [here](./01.%20Vectorization%20and%20Embeddings)

- Count Vectorizer
- Stemming and Lemmatization
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)
- Application: Recommender System using TF-TDF

## Markov Models
These models consist of an initial distribution of the tokens, and a transition matrix, and an assumption that the distribution of a token is independent of any token before the immediate previous token. Some applications of these models are [here](./02.%20Markov%20Models)
